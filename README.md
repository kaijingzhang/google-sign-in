# google-sign-in
There’s a new way to create accounts on mobile web with one-tap using a Google email address. This functionality includes an “email selector” listing active gmail and other addresses provided by Google, inline on the page, for one-tap sign-in or sign-up
This also includes automatic returning user sign-in, providing the user’s previously selected information on page load (including stored passwords in browsers that support the Credential Managment API) and facilitating immediate personalization. The API is based on the OpenYOLO protocol, a new standard for credential exchange in web browsers that will support any email address or other form of identity (e.g. phone numbers)
This repo showcases how Google Smart Lock can be implemented on a website.
